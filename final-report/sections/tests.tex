\chapter{Tests}
\section*{Server}
The verifications done to test the functionalities realized on the server side where to do all possible error and success requests to all the controllers created, using the Postman tool. \\
However, before the final delivery the service's functionalities will be tested with Spring Test Tools. 

\section*{Client}
In the Client Application no explicit tests to verify the functionalities were created, however the way used to analyze the 
application were through the user experience, with and without network connection, using the device Nexus 5X 26 2.
In the future, to test the client, Mockito will be used to test Android API calls and UI Automator to exercise user interaction in instrumented tests.
