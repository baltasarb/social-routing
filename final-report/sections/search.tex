\chapter{Search}
When searching for a route, there are two type of requests that can be made,
search by a location (city) or search by the user area (user geographic coordinates). 

\section{Search by location}
When planning a trip, a person might not be in the place where it wants to perform the route and
this functionality explores that idea. 

The chosen location filters routes that are in a specific area, which the user can then filter even more
using the route metadata available such as route categories or duration.

\section{Search by user location}
When a user wants routes close to his current location this is the request to make. 
The routes considered are the ones that are close up to 1km. If no route is found then the distance is increased
to try and find routes that are relevant to the user. Of course further filtering is also possible, for instance
one can ask for routes in the 1km radius, but only if they are close to the sea (category).
